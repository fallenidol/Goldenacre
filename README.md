# Goldenacre
My dumping ground of useful stuff, mostly extension methods, that I find myself writing over and over again.

There are two projects:
- The Core library, which only references the System dll.
- The Winforms library, which only references the System dll and the System.Windows.Forms dll.

Neither library references any NuGet packages.

#### Usage ####

The intended usage is, rather than reference a compiled Goldenacre dll, just copy and paste the desired class or classes into your project.
